      <h1 class="display-5 ">Traditionally, spending more time in school can improve the quality of the student's education</h1>
      <p class="display-7">As a study showed that "Improved learning time program improved literarcy and math achievement when instruction was led by certified teacers, though the effect was small." Simply put.  There are benefits to simply making students spend more time in the classroom that have shown small improvement for students taking those compared to students who don't.</p>
      <p class="display-7">Beside that, the study also showed that " Increased learning time improved the literacy achievement of students performing below standards and the social-emotional skills of students with attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder." This mean that Increasing learning time helps students who are already below their peers and help them improve drastically compared to a normal student who also took more time learning.
