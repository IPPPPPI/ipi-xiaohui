  <!-- STEP TWO: CUSTOMIZE THE LOOK-->
  <!-- Make adjustments to the display size, text color, background color, border, text alignment, etc... -->
  <!-- Use 4 different types of bootstrap classes -->
  <!-- The best way to do this is to search using the navbar. Put in a term OR a class tag -->
  <!-- A few pages that should be helpful to start out with.... 
    Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/content/typography/ to adjust the display (size, etc)
    Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/color/ to adjust color attributes 
    (there's also different pages with background color, opacity, etc )-->

In the U.S, "a study by the National Center for Education Statistics found that 14 percent of US schools exceed capacity. Of course, the problem is concentrated and disproportionately affects low-income and minority students."        </li>

For example, a women in Los Angles has describe her children's learning situtation as "[Andrade] struggled to support her children with distance learning…Andrade’s son, who began high school in the fall as a strong student, ended up failing English and biology, in part because he didn’t know his teachers well and was too embarrassed to ask for help, she said. Her daughter, a very social fifth-grader, has expressed suicidal thoughts. Andrade has had both of them in therapy for a year."</li>
