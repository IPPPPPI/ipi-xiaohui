  <!-- Make adjustments to the display size, text color, background color, border, text alignment, etc... -->
  <!-- Use 4 different types of bootstrap classes -->
  <!-- The best way to do this is to search using the navbar. Put in a term OR a class tag -->
  <!-- A few pages that should be helpful to start out with.... 
    Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/content/typography/ to adjust the display (size, etc)
    Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/color/ to adjust color attributes

          <h1>Root Causes #1</h1>
          <p>Disadvantaged students perform worse not because of bad teachers or school issues, but rather government reforms meant to improve disadvantaged students such as No child Left behind and Standardization Test has made it even worse for disadvantaged students.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="col border border-warning border border-4 text-start bg-dark text-primary">
           <li>Evidence 1: “NCLB has generated a range undesirable side effects -including large numbers of failing schools , narrowing of the curriculum, low morale among teachers who are facing pressure to achieve goals that they cannot meet, and, as has become abundantly clear in recent months by the cheating scandals in Atlanta and elsewhere, significant amounts of cheating by teachers under extreme pressure to raise student test scores.”"</li>
          </div>
          <div class="col border border-dark border border-4 text-start bg-info text-dark">
            <li>Explanation 1: No Child Left Behind (also known as NCLB) has pressured teachers to inflate scores to meet the standard. It has closed schools that failed to meet the standard when it already has limited resources serving as low income schools.</li>
          </div>
          <div class="col border border-warning border border-4 text-start bg-dark text-primary">
            <li>Evidence 2: “The best U.S. evidence to date indicates that providing financial incentives for teachers to raise test scores does not lead to the desired results. In a recent experiment in which randomly assigned math teachers in grades 5-8 in Nashville were offered large bonuses for raising their students' test scores, for example, no differences emerged in the test scores of those teacher offered the incentive and those in the control group”</li>
          </div>
          <div class="col border border-dark border border-4 text-start bg-info text-dark">
            <li>Explanation 2: Raising a teacher's salary based on scores doesn't improve a student's score. The incentives doesn't work as there is no different in both study groups

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col border border-dark border border-4 bg-warning text-dark">
          <h1>Root Causes #2</h1>
          <p>Students having more choices of schools doesn't necessarily mean better results for student scores, with school vouchers and charter school has only caused more decline in student's scores.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="col border border-danger border border-4 text-start bg-primary text-warning">
           <li>Evidence 1: “The patterns were particularly dramatic in my 2007 study of charter schools in North Carolina with Robert Bifulco, where we found that the students in charter schools serving large proportions of minority students exhibited even greater adverse effects on student achievement than students in charter schools serving more middle class students”</li>
          </div>
          <div class="col border border-primary border border-4 text-start bg-danger text-white">
            <li>Explanation 1: Charter schools have no or negative  improvement for disadvantaged students. It also drains resources away from public schools that serve most of the disadvantaged students.</li>
          </div>
          <div class="col border border-danger border border-4 text-start bg-primary text-warning">
            <li>Evidence 2: “few charter schools appear to be doing a good job of promoting academic success among children from disadvantaged families, albeit often with the help of substantial additional resources from private philanthropists or from charismatic leaders.”</li>
          </div>
          <div class="col border border-primary border border-4 text-start bg-danger text-white">
            <li>Explanation 2: Charter schools require more resources than public schools while only doing better when there is outside support other than the government coming in to support them. If those resources were given to a public school, then they could perform just as good as some of the charter schools</li>

          <div class="col border border-secondary border border-4 bg-secondary text-white">
            <h1>Implication for both root causes</h1>
              <li>Government reforms have already been tried to improve both students and disadvantaged students with little or negative improvement in student's education. The government needs a better way to approach this issue as the current solutions have only caused worse score feedback. The historical trend of the U.S. being ahead of other countries has drastically dropped and forces teachers to cheat to meet standards. More support for charter schools through school vouchers only makes disadvantaged students perform worse. School voucher itself has drains public resources away from public schools which still support the majority of disadvantaged students. The competition between charter and public only hurts students' education.</li>
